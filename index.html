it's monday

we would have had our date tonight. it's taking everything in my power to not call you. i'm dying to know what you're thinking. it is tearing me apart inside. i used to hear them every day.
i loved hearing them so much. i'm such a fucking idiot. by now you must have realized how terrible i really was for you. i'm sorry i left. i'm so sorry. i got so afraid. now i know pain beyond my wildest nightmares.
this is all my fault. i had either two choices. either stay with you and feel a lot of pain. or leave you and feel a lot of pain. i was a fool to think this would be the easier option. 
i would have much prefered to stick it out and deal with that pain. at least i could have still heard your voice. i don't want to call you right now and throw you all off balance while you're trying to heal from what i did. 
god, what have i done? why do i always do this? why do i ruin every single thing that is good for me? i don't even care if you wouldn't take me back. i just want to hear your voice again. i miss it so fucking much. 
it feels like it's been an eternity since i've heard it. i tried killing myself again today. i'm just so lost. i wish i could spend so many hours talking to you. instead all i feel is fucking numb. 

i'm so sorry. i love you so much. leaving you only made that worse. i wish i could hear your voice so badly. now i'm just repeating myself. fuck. i'm so sorry. i love you.
